# Bracelet-MatchMaker
Bracelet MatchMaker is a smart bracelet which enables its users to meet new people accroding to criteria. The user enter his data (E.g. age, height, gender, hobbies, etc.) and the data he seeks in the other person, into a dedicated smartphone application.  
When two users wearing the bracelet enter a range that also allows for WiFi reception, the bracelet directs them towards each other if they are compatible according to the criteria. 
Inside a building the bracelet uses WiFi transmission and reception alone, but outdoors it also uses GPS. The bracelet can be used for romantic purposes but is also suitable for meeting people in crowded places. 

Code written under Arduino IDE.
